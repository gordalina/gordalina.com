summary: An elixir library for projects that require secrets and want to inject them in a secure way without having to depend on secret files or hardcoded configuration.

Today I am happy to announce [Hush](https://github.com/gordalina/hush), the simplest way to inject secrets into your app configuration.

Hush was purpose built to solve a common use case for projects that require secrets and want to inject them in a secure way without having to depend on secret files or hardcoded configuration.


## Background & Motivation

As an web applications engineer, I've always been interested in understanding and engineering the whole stack, from managing & configuring servers, all the way up the stack to frontend development. In my journey of working at several startups, and building my own projects, I've developed a an infrastructure engineering skillset.

Fast-forward to 2020, I was working on a new project and wanted to deploy an Elixir API in a containerized environment and realized that, by default, Elixir apps include a `prod.secrets.exs` which is used to configure an application in a production environment.

The standard approach would require us to build docker images on a per-environment basis, which would have to include said secrets within them â€” this was not an ideal scenario.

Slab, [the knowledge base that democratizes knowledge](https://slab.com), discovered the limits of this production configuration. As their team grew, sharing and maintaining this approach became more difficult â€” as did the security concerns of having secrets in docker images.

As such, there was a need for a tool that could solve these problems and enable the deployment of docker images to any environment without having hardcoded secrets, as well as solving for config & dev/prod parity in the [twelve factor app methodology](https://12factor.net/).

Hush demonstrated that it elegantly solved the problem and simplified their environment.

## Example

Hush implements Elixir's `Config.Provider` behavior, giving you a familiar and supported way to configure Elixir applications.

In this example we can see a production configuration using three providers; AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secrets Manager, and System Environment.

```elixir
# config/prod.exs
alias Hush.Provider.{AwsSecretsManager, GcpSecretManager, SystemEnvironment}

config :app, Web.Endpoint,
  http: [port: {:hush, SystemEnvironment, "PORT", [cast: :integer]}]

config :app, App.Repo,
  password: {:hush, GcpSecretManager, "CLOUDSQL_PASSWORD"}

config :app, App.RedshiftRepo,
  password: {:hush, AwsSecretsManager, "REDSHIFT_PASSWORD"}
```

## Features

Hush ships, today, with the following features:

- Extensible providers. Current available providers are:
  - [AwsSecretsManager](https://github.com/gordalina/hush_aws_secrets_manager)
  - [GoogleSecretManager](https://github.com/gordalina/hush_gcp_secret_manager)
  - SystemEnvironment reads configuration from environmental variables.
- Configuration Provider in [runtime and release mode](https://github.com/gordalina/hush#usage).
- [Cast configuration values](https://github.com/gordalina/hush#casting) to native elixir types.
- Writing configuration values [to files](https://github.com/gordalina/hush#transfomers).
- Extensible transformers - [example of a custom transformer](https://github.com/gordalina/hush#writing-your-own-transfomer).

All these features are thoroughly documented on [hexdocs.pm/hush](https://hexdocs.pm/hush).

Finally, I'd want to invite the community to ask any questions, contribute, or submit ideas on [Hush's Issue Tracker](https://github.com/gordalina/hush/issues).
